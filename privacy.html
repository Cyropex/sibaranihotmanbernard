        <p>We may process certain types of personal data about you as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identity Data</strong> may include your first name, maiden name, last name, username, marital status, title, date of birth and gender.</li>

        <p>Where we are required to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of the contract between you and us and you do not provide us with that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract (for example, to provide services to you). If you don&rsquo;t provide us with the requested data, we may have to cancel a product or service you have requested but if we do, we will notify you at the time.</p>

        <p><strong>Marketing communications&nbsp;</strong></p>
        
        <p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested them from us and have not subsequently opted out of receiving that marketing.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by emailing us at iIHQ-DPO@salvationarmy.org.</p>
        
        <p>Where you opt out of receiving our marketing communications, this will not apply to any personal data you may have provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transaction.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>Change of purpose</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to find out more about how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please email us at IHQ-DPO@salvationarmy.org</p>
        
        <p>If we need to use your personal data for a purpose unrelated to the purpose for which we collected the data, we will notify you and we will explain the lawful basis for the processing.</p>
        
        <p>We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>We may have to share your personal data with the third parties set out below for the purposes/activities set out in the table in paragraph 4 above:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Other Salvation Army territories, commands, regions, divisions, corps, centres, outposts as necessary to assist with an enquiry you have initiated or delivery of a service you have requested from us.</li>
            <li>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services</li>
            <li>Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
            <li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities based in the United Kingdom and other relevant jurisdictions who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
            <li>Third parties with whom we have a legal and established working relationship, in order to provide services requested.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We require all third parties to whom we transfer your personal data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Where necessary, we share your personal data within the wider, international Salvation Army, which may involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>)</p>
        
        <p>Countries outside of the EEA&nbsp;do not always offer the same levels of protection for personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.</p>
        
        <p>Many of our third party service providers are based outside the EEA&nbsp;so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
        
        <p>Whenever we transfer personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe;&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
        
        <p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:IHQ-DPO@salvationarmy.org">IHQ-DPO@salvationarmy.org</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>DATA SECURITY</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to receive such data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
        
        <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>DATA RETENTION</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
        
        <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
        
        <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.</p>
        
        <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request transfer of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Right to withdraw consent.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>You can see more about these rights at: <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/">https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/</a></p>
        
        <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please email us at <a href="mailto:IHQ-DPO@salvationarmy.org">IHQ-DPO@salvationarmy.org</a>.</p>
        
        <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data or to exercise any of the other rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
        
        <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
        
        <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
